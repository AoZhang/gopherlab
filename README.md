# gophernotes - Go in Notebooks

## Note: This project was forked from the original gophernotes project, large parts of the documentation in this file are not directly usable at this point.

`gophernotes` is a Go kernel for [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks.  Finally, we can have a reliable and maintained way to use Go interactively and code in the browser.  Use `gophernotes` to create and share documents that contain live Go code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text.  These notebooks, with the live Go code, can then be shared with others via email, Dropbox, GitHub and the [Jupyter Notebook Viewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).  Go forth and do data science, or anything else interesting, with go notebooks!

The original `gophernotes` project came out of the [Gopher Gala](http://gophergala.com/) 2016.
It is inspired by a REPL called [gore](https://github.com/motemen/gore) and by a, no longer maintained and self-described as limited, ipython kernel call [iGo](https://github.com/takluyver/igo).

## Installation

### Docker

- Pull down and run the [latest image](https://hub.docker.com/r/dwhitena/gophernotes/):

  ```
  docker pull dwhitena/gophernotes:latest
  docker run --name gophernotes --net host -d dwhitena/gophernotes:latest
  ```

*Possible issues* - For OSX Docker Machine / Dlite users, you may need to set the IP to `0.0.0.0` instead of the default  `localhost` with:

  ```
  docker run --net host -d dwhitena/gophernotes jupyter notebook --no-browser --ip=0.0.0.0
  ```

*Note* - this is a pretty large image, because it contains a full distribution of [Anaconda](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/index) plus the add ons of gophernotes.  However, with this image, you can create Go notebooks, Python notebooks, text files, run ipython in the shell, etc.

### Local, Linux

- Dependencies:

  - [Go](https://golang.org/) (Tested with Go 1.5 and 1.6)
  - Jupyter (see [here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html) for more details on installing jupyter)
  - [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/) (2.2.X or 4.x)

- Create a workspace and setup your `GOPATH`, see https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH

- Install `goimports` if you haven't already:

  ```
  go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports
  ```

- Get the kernel:
  - with ZeroMQ 2.2.x:

    ```
    go get github.com/gopherds/gophernotes
    ```
  
  - with ZeroMQ 4.x:

    ```
    go get -tags zmq_4_x github.com/gopherds/gophernotes
    ```

- Create a directory for the new kernel config:

  ```
  mkdir -p ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/gophernotes
  ```

- Copy the kernel config into the `jupyter` directory:

  ```
  cp -r $GOPATH/src/github.com/gopherds/gophernotes/kernel/* ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/gophernotes
  ```
  
  Note, depending on which version of jupyter you are using and if you are using Anaconda, you may need to copy to `~/.ipython` rather than `~/.local/share`:
  
  ```
  mkdir ~/.ipython/kernels/gophernotes
  cp -r $GOPATH/src/github.com/gopherds/gophernotes/kernel/* ~/.ipython/kernels/gophernotes/
  ```

### Local, OSX

- Assuming you're running with `homebrew`, install go:

  ```
  brew install go
  mkdir ~/go
  export GOPATH=$HOME/go
  export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/opt/go/libexec/bin:$GOPATH/bin
  ```

- You'll probably want to add the above exports to your `.bashrc` or equivalent.

- Install ZeroMQ:

  ```
  brew tap homebrew/versions
  brew install zeromq22
  brew link --force zeromq22
  ```

- Install gophernotes:

  ```
  go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports
  go get github.com/gopherds/gophernotes
  ```
  
  if you get this error:
  
  ```
  # pkg-config --cflags libzmq libzmq libzmq libzmq
  Package libzmq was not found in the pkg-config search path.
  Perhaps you should add the directory containing `libzmq.pc'
  to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
  No package 'libzmq' found
  ```
  
  then:
  
  ```
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/zeromq22/lib/pkgconfig/

  ```

- Copy the kernel config:

  ```
  mkdir -p ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/gophernotes
  cp -r $GOPATH/src/github.com/gopherds/gophernotes/kernel/* ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/gophernotes
  ```
  
  Note, depending on which version of jupyter you are using and if you are using Anaconda, you may need to copy to `~/.ipython` rather than `~/.local/share`:
  
  ```
  mkdir ~/.ipython/kernels/gophernotes
  cp -r $GOPATH/src/github.com/gopherds/gophernotes/kernel/* ~/.ipython/kernels/gophernotes/
  ```

- Update `~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/gophernotes/kernel.json` with the path to your $GOPATH installation.  If you used the path above, your file will look like:

  ```
  {
      "argv": [
        "/Users/<your username>/go/bin/gophernotes",
        "{connection_file}"
        ],
      "display_name": "Golang",
      "language": "go",
      "name": "go"
  }
  ```

## Getting Started

- If you completed one of the local installs above (i.e., not the Docker install), start the jupyter notebook:

  ```
  jupyter notebook
  ```

- Select `Golang` from the `New` drop down menu.

- Have Fun!


## Troubleshooting

### gophernotes not found
- Depending on your environment, you may need to manually change the path to the `gophernotes` executable in `kernel/kernel.json` before copying it to `~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/gophernotes`.  You can put the **full path** to the `gophernotes` executable here, and you shouldn't have any further issues.


### "Kernel error" in a running notebook

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/notebook/base/handlers.py", line 458, in wrapper
    result = yield gen.maybe_future(method(self, *args, **kwargs))
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tornado/gen.py", line 1008, in run
    value = future.result()
  ...
  File "/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.11/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/subprocess.py", line 1335, in _execute_child
    raise child_exception
OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
```

Stop jupyter, if it's already running.

Add a symlink to `/go/bin/gophernotes` from your path to the gophernotes executable. If you followed the instructions above, this will be:

```
sudo ln -s $HOME/go/bin/gophernotes /go/bin/gophernotes
```

Restart jupyter, and you should now be up and running.


## Custom Commands
Some of the custom commands from the [gore](https://github.com/motemen/gore) REPL have carried over to `gophernotes`.  Note, in particular, the syntax for importing packages:

```
:import <package path>  Import package
:print                  Show current source (currently prints to the terminal where the notebook server is running)
:write [<filename>]     Write out current source to file
:help                   List commands
:containerize           Build a Docker image that executes the compiled Go code (must have Docker installed)
```
